This program was built to take in a list of items that were checked out and documented inside of a .txt file and make these accessible to the client. 
The features that standout the most in this program was good function descriptions, utilization of a map to grab the keys such as items and pair this with the frequency.
Enhancements to this code base would be to make this more appealing to the user by adding terminal background colors and foreground colors.
I found to be the most challenging was to accurately setup the .txt file to be read inside of the correct directory and then store it inside of the map.
Identifying what I want to make public and private for security purposes when I build out my classes.
I utilized a class and inside of the class I built out the features for this program using good descriptive funcitons making for a more maintainable application.
Furthermore, I am also able to go inside this class and add more functions inside of this code base or alter the ones I have created to adapt to a number of requirements.
